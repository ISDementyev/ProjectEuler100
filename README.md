# ProjectEuler100
My attempts at problems 1-100 from the Project Euler Archives (projecteuler.net) 

## Layout
Each directory in problems/ corresponds to a problem. If the directory for a problem is available, it means I was successful in solving the problem.

Each directory contains at least one file - a python file which contains a function that solves the problem. Sometimes, an optimized version written by me 
will be available and distinguished clearly from the non-optimized functions within the same py file. Types of optimization include (but are not limited to) vectorizations with Numpy and just-in-time compilation.
